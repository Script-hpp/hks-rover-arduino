## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Install Arduino IDE

Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (version 2.0 or higher recommended).

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Open Arduino IDE and install the following libraries via **Library Manager** (Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries):

- **ArduinoMqttClient** by Arduino
- **WiFiS3** (included with Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board support)

### 3. Install Board Support

1. Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**
2. Search for "Arduino UNO R4 WiFi"
3. Install the board package

### 4. Create Secrets File

Create a file named `arduino_secrets.h` in the same directory as `rover.ino`:

```cpp
#define SECRET_SSID "YourWiFiSSID"
#define SECRET_PASS "YourWiFiPassword"
```


### 5. Upload the Code

1. Connect your Arduino UNO R4 WiFi via USB
2. Select **Tools → Board → Arduino UNO R4 WiFi**
3. Select the correct **Port**
4. Click **Upload** (→)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### WiFi Settings

Edit `arduino_secrets.h`:
```cpp
#define SECRET_SSID "YourNetworkName"
#define SECRET_PASS "YourNetworkPassword"
```

### MQTT Broker Settings

Edit `rover.ino` (lines 47-49):
```cpp
const char broker[] = "your-broker-ip-or-domain";
int port = 1883;
const char topic[] = "rover/control";
```

### Speed Settings

Adjust motor speeds in `rover.ino` (lines 55-56):
```cpp
int baseSpeed = 160;  // Base speed (0-255)
int maxSpeed = 255;   // Maximum speed for boost mode
```

## 📡 MQTT Commands

The rover listens to the `rover/control` topic and responds to the following commands:

| Command | Action | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `forward` | Move forward | Both front motors forward |
| `backward` | Move backward | Both front motors backward |
| `left` | Strafe left | Diagonal movement using all motors |
| `right` | Strafe right | Diagonal movement using all motors |
| `rotate-left` | Rotate counterclockwise | Motors in opposite directions |
| `rotate-right` | Rotate clockwise | Motors in opposite directions |
| `stop` | Stop all motors | Emergency stop |
| `gas` | Boost mode | Maximum speed on all motors |

### MQTT Topics

- **Subscribe**: `rover/control` - Receives movement commands
- **Publish**: `rover/status` - Sends connection status on startup
- **Publish**: `rover/heartbeat` - Sends heartbeat every 30 seconds

## 📷 Camera Setup (ESP32-CAM)

The `camera.ino` file contains firmware for the **ESP32-CAM** module to stream video to the web interface.

> **⚠️ Note**: This code was written in a rush and does not follow best practices. It works but could be optimized for better performance and error handling.

### Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32-CAM** module (AI Thinker model)
- **Arduino IDE** (for uploading code)
- **External 5V power supply** (ESP32-CAM draws too much current for USB)

### Installation

1. **Install ESP32 Board Support** in Arduino IDE:
   - Go to **File → Preferences**
   - Add to "Additional Board Manager URLs": `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`
   - Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**
   - Search for "ESP32" and install

2. **Select Board**:
   - **Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino → AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Edit `arduino_secrets.h` with your WiFi credentials
   - Update `serverURL` in `camera.ino` to point to your Node.js server

4. **Upload**:
   - Connect ESP32-CAM to Arduino IDE
   - Set **GPIO 0 to GND** (programming mode)
   - Upload the code
   - Remove GPIO 0 connection and reset

### How It Works

The ESP32-CAM:
1. Connects to WiFi
2. Captures JPEG frames at ~5 FPS
3. Sends frames to `/api/camera/upload` endpoint via HTTP POST
4. The web interface fetches frames from `/api/camera/stream`

### Known Issues

- **Memory limitations**: ESP32-CAM has limited SRAM (~4KB), so large images may cause crashes
- **No error recovery**: If upload fails, the camera doesn't retry
- **Hardcoded settings**: Frame size and quality are not configurable without code changes
- **Our hardware broke**: The ESP32-CAM stopped working after extended use due to hardware limitations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues

**Problem**: Arduino cannot connect to WiFi.

**Solution**:
- Verify SSID and password in `arduino_secrets.h`
- Ensure WiFi network is 2.4GHz (Arduino UNO R4 WiFi does not support 5GHz)
- Check WiFi signal strength near the rover

### MQTT Connection Fails

**Problem**: Arduino connects to WiFi but MQTT connection fails.

**Solution**:
- **Firewall Restrictions**: Most public and home networks block MQTT port 1883. The rover **only works over mobile hotspot** or requires **tunneling/reverse proxy** setup.
- Verify broker IP address and port in `rover.ino`
- Check that the MQTT broker is running and accessible
- Use Serial Monitor to view detailed error codes

### Motors Not Responding

**Problem**: MQTT connection is successful but motors don't move.

**Solution**:
- Check motor driver connections and power supply
- Verify pin assignments match your hardware setup
- Ensure external power supply is connected (USB power is insufficient)
- Use Serial Monitor to confirm commands are being received

### Serial Monitor Shows Connection Errors

**Problem**: `TCP Connection: FAILED!` or `MQTT Connection: FAILED`

**Solution**:
- **Network Restrictions**: The code includes connectivity tests. If TCP fails but Google DNS (8.8.8.8) succeeds, your network is blocking the MQTT broker.
- **Workaround**: Use a mobile hotspot or set up NGINX reverse proxy (see web interface README)
- Check broker IP and port configuration

## 📊 Serial Monitor Output
